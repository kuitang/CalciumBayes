Algorithm

	Initialize parameters based on some sort of prior estimation
	
	Do MAP estimation using some sort of EM/iterative alg
		Each iteration, until convergence:
			Estimate some set of parameters using sampling
			Estimate remainder of parameters
			Run the prior on new estimates
	

To Do:

Kui: Take a look at Mischenko and new Stevenson paper and figure out what methods we might use to do MAP estimation.

Ben: Initialization
